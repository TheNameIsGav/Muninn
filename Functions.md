# List of Muninn Functions

The following is a list of functions used in Muninn and what they do. Muninn is death.

## Add Game
`add_game` adds a user-defined game to the games database.

This function uses a `title`, a `publisher`, an array of `tags`, and `platforms`.

It first checks to see if the requirements (a title, a publisher, tags, and platforms) have been filled in, and if not, returns a 401. If they have been filled in, it makes a new game with the inputted information. Before adding this game to the database, the function checks to see if this game has already been added to the database by searching for its title in the database. If the game does already exist, the game isn't added to the database and tells the user that a similar game has been found in the database. If the game is found not to already exist, the game gets saved to the database and tells the user that it's been added to the database.

## Add User
`add_user` adds a user to the list of all users.

This function uses a `username`, a `password`, and an `email`.

The function first checks to see if the username or email matches that of an existing user. If either of these does match an existing user, the user is informed that the user they are trying to create already exists. If they don't match an existing user, then the password is hashed and a new user is created using the username, password, and email. A 401 is sent if there is an error in this process.

## Login
`login` allows users to successfully login to their account on Muninn.

This function uses a `username`, a `password`, and an `email`.

The function first checks to see if the username exists in the list of existing users. If not, then the user is informed that the username hasn't been found and a 401 is sent. If it does exist, then the function checks to see if the password matches the username. If not, then the user if informed that there's a password mismatch and a 401 is sent. If it does match, then the user id is successfully sent.

## Add Review
`add_review` adds a review to a specific game by a specific user.

This function uses a `userId`, a `gameId`, a `desc`, and a `rating`.

The function first creates a new review using the userId, gameId, desc, and rating and saves the review. It then adds the review to the user's reviews. After this, the function calculates the new average rating of the game being reviewed with the new review score being taken into account, then changes the game's rating to this calculated average rating. Finally, the review is added to the game's reviews.
